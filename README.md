## Introduction
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English and British English), or Xs and Os (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil (before) game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. ![tic tac toe](http://www.thepopularapps.com/application/upload/Apps/2017/05/tic-tac-toe-game-free-29.png)
