# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English and British English), or Xs and Os (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil (before) game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

### History
An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called 'terni lapilli' (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome.
   
The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884.
In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games.

In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements.
   
Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees.
   
If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.
