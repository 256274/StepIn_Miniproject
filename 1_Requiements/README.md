## Cost and Features
The cost of the game depends on the requirements of players. It can be modelled as a 3D game which requires heavy software tools, we can add music, we can make it an online game which requires database, or it can as simple as entering from keypad of a old model mobile phone. 

As we are planning to design a simple game with a very basic user interface (UI), the cost required is zero if a computer available.

The code is about 100 lines.

## Defining Our System
The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m√ón board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row.

Once the game is opened it first shows the board, game instructions and a demo how to play.
