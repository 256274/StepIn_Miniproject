## Cost and Features
The cost of the game depends on the requirements of players. It can be modelled as a 3D game which requires heavy software tools, we can add music, we can make it an online game which requires database, or it can as simple as entering from keypad of a old model mobile phone. 

As we are planning to design a simple game with a very basic user interface (UI), the cost required is zero if a computer available.

The code is about 100 lines.

## Defining Our System
The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m√ón board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row.

Once the game is opened it first shows the board, game instructions and a demo how to play.

## 4W's and 1H
### Who:
This a 2 player game.

### What:
This game is played on a 3 x 3 grid of available cells, and the goal of the game is to match three of your tokens (X or O) on the board in a row, column or diagonally.

### When:
This game mostly ends up in a draw. So this can be played when you don't want to loose or you got you don't want to use much of your brain :-)

### Where:
Can be played by anyone and anywhere. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.

### How:
To win, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
